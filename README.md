# MojangStatus
A simple yet customizable mod to show Mojang's status (1.8.9)

## Commands
`/mojangstatus` - **Configure the mod**

`/checkstatus` - **Manually check Mojang status (will only show notifications if it has changed since last check)**

## Note
The `Debug` and `No Changes` options are kinda buggy and annoying. It's not recommended to use them.
They just allow you to force notifications to show even if the status hasn't changed
